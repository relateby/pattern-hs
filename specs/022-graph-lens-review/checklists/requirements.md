# Specification Quality Checklist: Graph Lens Design Review

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- ✅ All checklist items pass validation
- ✅ Analysis complete - Design approved by user
- ✅ Categorical functor relationship resolved: Graph lens IS the intended categorical functor approach
- ✅ User decision obtained: APPROVE - ready for implementation
- ✅ Analysis document created at `analysis.md` with complete critique and recommendations
- Specification is complete - analysis phase finished, ready for implementation planning in next feature
