# Quick Start

## What You'll Learn

In this quick start, you'll:
- Create your first Pattern
- Access pattern components
- Transform patterns with Functor
- See a complete example

## Prerequisites

- Basic Haskell knowledge
- GHC 9.12.2 or later
- Pattern library installed

## Your First Pattern

[Simple example creating an atomic pattern]

## Working with Patterns

[Example showing construction, access, and transformation]

## Complete Example: Route 66

[Complete example showing Route 66 as a pattern with segments]

## Next Steps

- Read [Basic Concepts](02-basic-concepts.md) for deeper understanding
- Explore [Typeclass Instances](05-typeclass-instances.md) for advanced operations
- See [Use Cases](07-use-cases.md) for real-world examples
```

### Key Elements

1. **What You'll Learn**: Clear learning objectives
2. **Prerequisites**: What users need before starting
3. **Simple Examples**: Very basic examples to get started
4. **Complete Example**: One complete example showing multiple concepts
